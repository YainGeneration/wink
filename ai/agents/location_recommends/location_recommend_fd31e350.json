The walls are a warm, creamy white and covered in exposed brick. There are a few dark-wood tables with wooden chairs scattered around, creating a small, intimate seating area. \n\nTwo lamps with red shades hang from the ceiling, casting a warm glow. A small table is set with a wine glass and a vase with a few flowers. To the right, a window offers a glimpse of the outside.  \n\nA brown wooden door with the word \"TOILET\" painted on it is set into the wall. On the opposite side of the room, a clothes rack displays a selection of colorful bags. The floor is a gray concrete. The overall feeling is relaxed and inviting. \n\nWould you like me to describe any particular element in more detail?, taken near 우리집앞.",
