  "english_caption_from_agent2": "Okay, here’s a description of the image in natural English:\n\nThis is a stunning, panoramic cityscape taken at dusk or dawn. The sky is a gorgeous blend of orange and pale yellow hues, typical of a beautiful sunset or sunrise. The cityscape itself is densely packed with skyscrapers and buildings, stretching out as far as the eye can see. \n\nIn the foreground, a very tall, modern building dominates the view, likely a skyscraper. Below it, we can see a busy road with illuminated cars, indicating a bustling city center. There's a mixture of residential and commercial buildings, all blending into a complex and impressive urban landscape. The light is warm and soft, creating a serene and captivating scene. \n\nIt’s a classic view of a major metropolitan area, full of life and energy. \n\nDo you want me to focus on a particular aspect of the image, or perhaps describe something else about it?, taken near 숙명여자대학교 정문.",
