The background features a range of snow-capped mountains under a clear, blue sky with fluffy white clouds. \n\nThe two snowmen are brightly colored – one is dressed in a blue knitted hat and scarf, and the other wears a red knitted hat and scarf. They’re both made of snow and have small, round coal eyes and red carrot noses.  The snow is pristine and untouched, suggesting a fresh snowfall. It's a very cheerful and wintery scene., taken near 숙대입구역.",
